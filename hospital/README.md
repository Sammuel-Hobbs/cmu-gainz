# Hospital Billing Estimation

This is adapted from an assignment in Heinz course *Applied Analytics: the Machine Learning Pipeline (95-845)*.  The task was to build a neural network regression model to estimate a costing multiplier that's associated with a given hospital admission.  
The data is from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care [MIMIC](https://mimic.physionet.org/about/mimic/) database.
