# Hospital Billing Estimation
This work is adapted from, and inspired by work performed in the Heinz course **Applied Analytics: the Machine Learning Pipeline** [95-845](https://api.heinz.cmu.edu/courses_api/course_detail/95-845).  
Much of the data modeled is from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care II [MIMIC](https://mimic.physionet.org/about/mimic/) database. 

## NN_Regression
This notebook is from the original assignment issued in the course to engage us in Deep Learning. The task was to build a neural network regression model to estimate a costing multiplier that's associated with a given hospital admission. The data used is from 5 tables in MIMIC II comprising information on lab events, procedure (treatments) events, and a cost-weight multiplier used in billing admissions.
